Access & Permission Troubleshooting Guide

Common Issues:
- Denied access to internal apps, SharePoint, or databases
- Missing group permissions

Possible Causes:

- Changes in policy or permission inheritance
- Expired credentials or revoked access
- Misconfigured IAM/AD settings

Resolution Steps:
1. Verify user role and group memberships.
2. Grant required permissions in AD, IAM, or application settings.
3. Check policy inheritance and adjust if needed.
4. Re-authenticate user and refresh tokens.
5. Test access and confirm resolution.

Tips:
- Maintain an access audit log for accountability.
- Periodically review role assignments and permissions.
